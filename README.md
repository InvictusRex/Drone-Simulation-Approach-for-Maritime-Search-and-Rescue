# Drone Simulation Approach for Maritime Search and Rescue

This repository contains the research paper, datasets, and implementation details for our study on drone-based simulation techniques for maritime Search and Rescue (SARS) operations. The project involved developing UAV systems, creating simulation environments, and training machine learning models for object detection in maritime scenarios.

## What is Maritime SARS and Why is it Important?

Maritime Search and Rescue (SARS) refers to operations conducted to locate and assist vessels, aircraft, or individuals in distress at sea. Given the vast and unpredictable nature of oceanic environments, traditional rescue methods often suffer from limitations such as slow response times, adverse weather conditions, and difficulties in locating small objects or people in large water bodies. 

The integration of autonomous drone technology with AI-driven object detection models offers a transformative approach to addressing these challenges. By leveraging UAVs, maritime SARS missions can become faster, more efficient, and highly scalable, significantly improving survival rates in emergency situations.

## Novelty of Our Approach

This research introduces a simulation-driven approach to maritime SARS, integrating drone technology with state-of-the-art deep learning models for object detection. Key contributions of our work include:

- **Comparative Study of YOLO Models:** We evaluate the performance of YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 on maritime SARS tasks, analyzing accuracy, speed, and real-world applicability.
- **High-Fidelity Simulation for Model Training:** Instead of relying solely on real-world data, we create a realistic virtual maritime environment to train and test detection models before real-world deployment.
- **Optimized UAV Systems for SARS Missions:** Our research explores how drone hardware and software can be fine-tuned for detecting distressed individuals and objects in vast oceanic settings.
