# Drone Simulation Approach for Maritime Search and Rescue

This repository contains the research paper, datasets, and implementation details for our study on drone-based simulation techniques for maritime Search and Rescue (SARS) operations. The project involved developing UAV systems, creating simulation environments, and training machine learning models for object detection in maritime scenarios.

## Project Overview

Maritime search and rescue operations require efficient and accurate detection of objects in vast oceanic environments. This research explores the integration of drone technology with YOLO-based deep learning models to enhance SARS operations. The key contributions of this work include:

- **Drone Development:** Custom-built UAV systems optimized for real-time search and rescue missions.
- **Machine Learning Model Training:** Comparative study using YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 for object detection in maritime environments.
- **Simulation Environment:** High-fidelity scenarios created to test model performance before real-world deployment.
